Sure! Here's a README file for your sentiment analysis project using Bidirectional LSTM:

Emotion Detection using Bidirectional LSTM
This project involves the development of an emotion detection system using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The system classifies text inputs into one of six emotions: joy, anger, love, sadness, fear, and surprise.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn keras tensorflow
Dataset
The dataset used for training, validation, and testing should be in .txt format with each line containing a sentence and its corresponding sentiment label separated by a semicolon (;).

Example:

vbnet
Copy code
I'm feeling great;joy
This is terrible;anger
Ensure that the dataset files train.txt, val.txt, and test.txt are placed in the appropriate directory.

Preprocessing
The text data is tokenized and converted into sequences using Keras' Tokenizer. The sequences are then padded to ensure uniform input length for the model. Sentiment labels are encoded into categorical format.

Model Architecture
The model is built using Keras' Sequential API and consists of the following layers:

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.
Dropout Layer: Prevents overfitting.
Bidirectional LSTM Layer: Captures dependencies from both forward and backward directions.
Another Bidirectional LSTM Layer: Further captures dependencies.
Dense Layer: Outputs a probability distribution over the emotion classes using softmax activation.
Training
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function. It is trained for 12 epochs with validation data for monitoring performance.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix are generated.

Usage
You can use the trained model to predict emotions for new sentences by using the predict function.

Example:

python
Copy code
def predict(sentence):
    sentence_lst = [sentence]
    sentence_seq = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentence_lst)
    sentence_padded = pad_sequences(sentence_seq, maxlen=80, padding='post')
    ans = get_key(model.predict(sentence_padded))
    print("The emotion predicted is", ans)

predict("I am so happy today!")
Results
Training Accuracy: 97.62%
Validation Accuracy: 93.10%
Test Accuracy: 92.35%
Confusion matrix and loss/accuracy curves can be plotted to visualize the performance.
